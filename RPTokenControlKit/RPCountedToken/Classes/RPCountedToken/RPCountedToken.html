<H1>RPCountedToken</H1><hr>
<b>Abstract: </b>RPCountedToken is an NSString with a count.
Although the count may be used for any arbitrary purpose, it is normally used to
represent the number of times that an RPCountedToken has been "added" to its parent collection.
Because its count is settable, it is used internally by RPTokenControl to represent tokens,
and may be used externally in applications where the inability to set the count makes
NSCountedSet too cumbersome.
